# phpRenameClass (alpha)

#### A refactoring tool for renaming PSR-0 name-spaced class files

### Features
#### File Renaming
* Renames namespaced class files and replaces the old class name in the code base.
	* Enter the namespaced old class name, a namespaced new class name and the directory that hold the code you would like to refactor. The plug-in will ask you to confirm all operations concerning the files system, and open all files it made changes to in a Sublime window. Each tab has the altered code that has not been saved. You can now look through the changed source files, and undo the changes, for as long as you don't close the window.
